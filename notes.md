-Installed lightbox2 for basic photo gallery

12/4/14

Some things I have to fix:
1. Resize the gallery image if its too small on load
2. Add some more animations to other parts of the site
3. Change gallery to simple light box so it doesn't take too long to load
4. Work on Footer
5. Change contact form on contact.html to be full width and secondary full-width contact information like StackCommerce
